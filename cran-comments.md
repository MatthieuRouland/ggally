Reached out to {bootclust} maintainer Mingmei Tian <mingmeit@buffalo.edu> about not importing `sets::%>%` to avoid conflict with (possibly) many packages.

Waiting until 2020-12-29 to submit.

New features added. Time to share them to CRAN.

Please let me know if there is anything I can provide!

Best,
